# JS Web3 SDK

While most of the existing SDKs should work out of the box, deploying smart contracts or using unique zkSync features, like paying fees in other tokens, requires providing additional fields to those that Ethereum transactions have by default.

To provide easy access to all of the features of zkSync 2.0, we created `zksync-web3` JavaScript SDK, which is based on the `ethers` JavaScript library. This section serves as its reference.
