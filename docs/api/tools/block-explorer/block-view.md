The block explorer home screen shows the 10 most recent blocks by default. To see a more complete overview of recent blocks, you can view all blocks. You can also click on a specific block number to see details about that particular block.
You can access the blocks page from the top menu as well.

## See all blocks

To see details of a specific block, just click on its block number. If you want to view more blocks, go to the [Blocks](https://explorer.zksync.io/blocks/) section in the navigation menu and use pagination to navigate to the next page.

If you are not on the homepage, you can still search for a block by typing in its block number. A block has two main sections.

A block has two main parts:

1. Block Header: It provides a summary of the block's information, along with a link to the previous block in the chain.

2. Transactions: It lists all the transactions that were included in the block.
