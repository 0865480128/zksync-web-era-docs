# Contract verification

## What is contract verification?

When you deploy a smart contract on a network, you’re essentially deploying the bytecode produced by the Solidity compiler.

Verifying a contract entails determining whether the on-chain bytecode matches a given source code when it is compiled. If it does, we can state that we have confirmed the bytecode's source code's integrity. Hence the name – verification.

## How are smart contracts verified in zkSync?

The deployed bytecode and the Solidity source code of a smart contract are compared during the verification process using zkSync Era. The algorithm compiles the source code to compare the generated bytecode to the deployed one.

If the two sides match in every way, the contract is verified.

You can verify your smart contract via the [hardhat plugin](../../hardhat/hardhat-zksync-verify.md), or the block explorer UI.

## Verifying Contracts Using the zkSync Era Block Explorer

To get started click the **Tools** tab in the top header, a dropdown will pop up and select **Smart Contract Verification**, after which you will be shown the following screen:

### Enter contract details

To verify the contract, enter the following details;

- **Contract address** : The address provided must match with the `0x` address generated during contract creation.
- **Compiler type** : It refers to the *single* or *multi-part* solidity file.
- **Contract name** : The name must be identical to the name provided in the contract.
- **Source code**, Copy/paste the code from your editor into the text area.

 ::: tip
  **Note:** You may need to flatten your Solidity code if it utilizes a library or inherits dependencies from another contract.
    We recommend using [Hardhat flatten](https://medium.com/coinmonks/flattening-smart-contracts-using-hardhat-dffe7dbc7b3f), [Truffle flattener](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/truffle-flattener) or the [POA Solidity flattener](https://github.com/poanetwork/solidity-flattener).
 ::: 

- **Solidity version** : The solidity version used in the code.
- **Optimization** : If you enabled optimization during contract compilation, select **Yes** otherwise select **No**
- **Constructor arguments** : 
- **Solidity compiler version(Solc)** : It refers to the exact version of the compiler used to compile a smart contract. Click on the dropdown to specify the compiler version used.
- **zkSync compiler version(Zksolc)** : The zkSync compiler version used during compilation, select `1.3.8`.

If any of these pieces of information is wrong, the process of verification fails.

- Lastly, click the **Verify Smart Contract** button.

If all goes well, you will see a success message, **Contract Verified**.
