# Contract verification

## What is contract verification?

When you deploy a smart contract on a network, you’re essentially deploying the bytecode produced by the Solidity compiler.

Verifying a contract entails determining whether the on-chain bytecode matches a given source code when it is compiled. If it does, we can state that we have confirmed the bytecode's source code's integrity. Hence the name – verification.

## How are smart contracts verified in zkSync?

During the verification process with zkSync Era, the smart contract's bytecode and Solidity source code are compared. The algorithm compiles the source code and checks if the generated bytecode matches the deployed bytecode. This helps ensure that the smart contract is implemented correctly and securely.

If the bytecode and source code match, the smart contract is considered verified. You can verify your smart contract using the [hardhat plugin](../../hardhat/hardhat-zksync-verify.md) or the block explorer UI.

## Verifying Contracts Using the zkSync Era Block Explorer

To get started click the **Tools** tab in the top header, a dropdown will pop up and select **Smart Contract Verification**, after which you will be shown the following screen:

### Enter contract details

To verify the contract, enter the following details;

- **Contract Address**: Enter the address that matches the 0x address generated during contract creation.
- **Compiler Type**: Specify if your contract is a single or multi-part solidity file.
- **Contract Name**: Enter the exact name of the contract as provided in the contract code.
- **Source Code**: Copy and paste the code from your editor into the text area.

 ::: tip
If your Solidity code uses a library or inherits dependencies from another contract, you may need to flatten it using tools such as [Hardhat flatten](https://medium.com/coinmonks/flattening-smart-contracts-using-hardhat-dffe7dbc7b3f), [Truffle flattener](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/truffle-flattener), or [POA Solidity flattener](https://github.com/poanetwork/solidity-flattener).
 ::: 

- **Solidity Version**: Specify the version of Solidity used in your code.
- **Optimization**: Select "Yes" if you enabled optimization during contract compilation, otherwise select "No".
- **Constructor Arguments**: If your contract has constructor arguments, provide them here.
- **Solidity Compiler Version (Solc)**: Select the exact version of the compiler used to compile your smart contract from the dropdown.
- **zkSync Compiler Version (Zksolc)**: Select `1.3.8` as the version of the zkSync compiler used during compilation.


If any of the provided information is incorrect, the verification process will fail. Once all details are filled in, click the **Verify Smart Contract** button.

If the verification is successful, you will see a **Contract Verified** success message.
