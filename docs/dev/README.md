# Getting started

**zkSync** is a trustless protocol that utilises [ZK Rollup technology](./concepts.md#what-are-zk-rollups) to provide scalable low-cost transactions on Ethereum. It uses zero-knowledge proofs to store all funds in a smart
contract on the mainchain, while computation and storing data are performed off-chain.

### zkSync features

- Mainnet-level security with zero reliance on 3rd parties.
- Permissionless smart contracts in Solidity.
- No registration is required to send or receive funds.
- Payments to existing Ethereum addresses (including smart-contracts).
- Fees are conveniently payable in the token being transferred.

## How should I proceed?

- Want to dive directly into the code? Head straight to the [Developer guide](./guide).
- If you are new to rollups, then [ZK Rollup Basics](./rollup.md) guide will help you get familiar with ZK Rollup architecture in general.
- If you already know how ZK Rollups work, then [Understanding zkSync 2.0](./zksync-v2) will serve as an introduction into the concepts behind zkSync 2.0.
