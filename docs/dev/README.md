# Getting started

::: danger ATTENTION: closed private preview

This documentation is a part of the closed private zkSync 2.0 testnet that is being rolled out gradually as our team wants to gather feedback before the public launch.

Please, **DO NOT** share this documentation or the network with anyone outside of your team yet.

:::

**zkSync 2.0** is a [ZK rollup](./rollups.md): a trustless protocol that utilises zero-knowledge proofs to provide scalable low-cost transactions on Ethereum. All assets are stored in a single smart
contract on the mainchain, while computation and storing data are performed off-chain.

### zkSync 2.0 highlights

- Mainnet-like security with zero reliance on 3rd parties.
- Permissionless EVM-compatible smart contracts.
- Standard Web3 API.
- Preserving key EVM features, such as smart contract composability.
- Introducing new features, such as account abstraction and meta-transactions.

### How to get started?

- Begin by [trying out](./private-testnet/user.md) the zkSync 2.0 UX yourself!
- If you are new to rollups, then [ZK rollup basics](./rollups.md) guide will help you get familiar with ZK rollup architecture in general.
- If you already know how ZK rollups work, then [Understanding zkSync 2.0](./zksync-v2) will serve as an introduction into the concepts behind zkSync 2.0.
- Want to dive directly into the code? Head straight to the [Developer guide](./guide).
