# Communication with L1

## Bridging native tokens from Ethereum

TODO.

## Calling contract methods from L1

Any L2 transaction can also be called from Ethereum. This feature is ready on zkSync side and will be available very soon as a part of the testnet.

## L2 -> L1 communication

Sending messages from zkSync to Ethereum mainnet is not yet available, but it will be implemented later.
