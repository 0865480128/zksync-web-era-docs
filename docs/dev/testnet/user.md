To get a first-hand impression of the zkSync 2.0 user experience:

- Go to the [zkSync 2.0 Portal](https://portal.zksync.io).
- Get some test tokens from the faucet, or deposit some from the GÃ¶rli testnet.
- Make some transfers.

The Portal will be the central entry point into the zkSync 2.0 ecosystem for users and developers alike. It will contain links to all relevant resources, such as block explorer or the catalog of featured dapps.
