## Adding content resources

We cannot promise to cover all aspects of zkSync so we attempt to highlight some of the community's outstanding resources such as videos, tutorials, articles etc.

If you believe that a content resource should be added to a page, be free to recommend its addition.

## How we decide
All learning resources, recommended by the community will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Is the content resource current?
- Is the content resource protected by a payment wall?
- Is the information trustworthy? Is it based on facts or opinions?
- How reputable is the author? Do they cite their references?
- Does the content resource provide anything new or different from what can be found on the documentation?
