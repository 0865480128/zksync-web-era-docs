# Token bridging and transfers

In order to bridge funds to or from zkSync, the [zkSync Wallet](https://zqgai-staging-wallet-v2.zksync.dev/) dApp should be used.

Also, for now, Metamask does not support transferring `ERC-20` tokens on zkSync, so the zkSync Wallet should be used for transfers inside zkSync as well.

## Moving funds to L2

Open the wallet and go to the `Deposit` tab:

Please note, that depositing requires your Metamask wallet to be connected to the `Rinkeby` test network.

Select the amount and the token that you want to bridge and proceed by clicking on the `Deposit` button.

## Moving funds to L1

Open the wallet and go to the `Withdraw` tab:

![Withdraw](/withdraw-1.png)

Please note, that withdrawing funds to L1 requires your Metamask wallet to be connected to the `zkSync alpha testnet` network. The tutorial on how to connect your Metamask to this network can be found [here](./connecting-to-metamask.md).

Select the amount and the token that you want to bridge and proceed by clicking the `Withdraw` button.

## Transfering funds inside zkSync

Open the wallet and go to the `Transfer` tab:

Please note, that transfering funds inside zkSync requires your Metamask wallet to be connected to the zkSync alpha testnet network. The tutorial on how to connect your Metamask to this network can be found [here](./connecting-to-metamask.md).

Select the recipient, the token and the samount of the token to transfer and processing by clicking the `Transfer` button.
