# 2.0 Overview

zkSync 2.0 is made to look and feel like Ethereum, but with lower fees. Just like on Ethereum, smart contracts are written in Solidity/Vyper and can be called using the same clients as the other EVM-compatible chains.

There is no need to register a separate private key to use zkSync. Existing Ethereum wallets work out of the box.
