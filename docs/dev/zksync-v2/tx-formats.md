# Transaction formats

Besides supporting native ETH transactions, zkSync supports the EIP712 transaction type. You can use transactions of this type to pay fees in ERC20 tokens. Additionally, it is only possible to deploy smart contracts with this type of transaction.

Knowing the details about the transaction format is not required to use zkSync's SDK, but if you are curious, you can read more about it [here](../api/api.md#eip712).
