# Transaction types

There are three types of L2 transactions on zkSync: `Withdraw`, `Execute`, `Deploy`.

- `Withdraw` is used to withdraw native ERC20 tokens to L1. _Please note that this type most likely will be removed after the testnet._
- `Execute` is used to call smart contract functions.
- `Deploy` is used to deploy smart contracts on zkSync.

There are also two types of transactions, related to bridging native tokens to zkSync:

- `Deposit` is used to move funds from an L1 account to an L2 account.
- `AddToken` is used to register a native ERC20 token to zkSync.
